1 Dataset
2 Take out independent and dependent features (X,y)
3 Cleaning the data - 1) stemming (lemmatization better but computationaly expensive) 2) stopwords
4 Fix a sentence length to fix the input
5 One hot representation, Embedding layer (see cbow, word2vec, etc.)
6 LSTM NN
7 Convert X and y to array and split into train-test
8 then train and check accuracy
